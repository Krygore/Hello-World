# Hello-World
Initial Repository made for GitHub, Also a location for my ideas
<p>My name is Krygore! I live in Washington USA in the middle of the woods. If I'm not at work as a house painter and the weather is crappy (like it usually is 70% of the year) I'm outside chainsaw carving! I only recently started to learn code, primarily HTML and CSS. Haven't quite gotten to starting JavaScript yet.</p>
<p>Some of the goals I have for learning to code include but are most definitely not limited to:<p>
<ul>
  <li>Front-end web development</li>
  <li>Open Source collaboration</li>
  <li>Possible career change??</li>
 </ul>
 <p>GitHub is completely new to me, so me for using tags to start this "readme.md" file.
